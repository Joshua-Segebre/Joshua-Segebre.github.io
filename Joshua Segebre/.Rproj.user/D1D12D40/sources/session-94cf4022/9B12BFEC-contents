My name is Joshua Segebre, I am a third-year studying Data Science and Psychology at Macalester College. I am from Miami, FL and Colombia. I am interested in combining data science with my interests including arts & culture, fashion, aviation, and traveling. Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy drinking coffee and spontaneous outing with friends.
